Both the [bird migration dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/turhancankargin/bird-migration) and [wildfires dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohammadrahdanmofrad/scars-of-the-earth-over-22-million-disasters) used in this project came from the website Kaggle.

Wildfires were filtered to between July 14, 2013 and May 30, 2014. Wildfire data was kept only near the bird migration paths, which means I deleted the data outside of an invisible rectangular bounding box of the wildfires. I also filtered wildfires that occurred 7 days before arrival. Wildfires that were 611 miles near any bird are also deleted.

I removed rows that have missing or not properly converted latitude/longitude/date values in both bird and wildfire datasets.
