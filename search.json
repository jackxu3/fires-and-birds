    "text": "Summary\nWildfires have been affecting migratory routes of birds. I downloaded two datasets from Kaggle about gull migration and global wildfires. We want to understand the relationship between fire proximity and other variables such as speed, altitude, and direction. The outcome modeled is wildfire proximity, a numeric variable, as a linear function of speed, altitude, and direction. Birds with higher proximity to fires were more likely to be have a lower altitude. For each one-degree counterclockwise increase in direction relative to the east, the model predicts that the distance to the nearest wildfire decreases by approximately 0.059 units with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -0.096 to -0.021."

The direction term when increased by 1 unit decreases the wildfire proximity by 0.059, with a 95% confidence interval between -0.096 and -0.021. The confidence interval does not pass through 0, making this term significant."
